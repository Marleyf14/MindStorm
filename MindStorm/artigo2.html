                    <br>Though space is about a thousand times emptier than even the best laboratory vacuums on Earth, it’s not
                    <br>completely devoid of matter – the sun’s constant outflow of solar wind fills space with a thin and tenuous
                    <br>wash of particles, fields, and plasma. This solar wind, along with other solar events like giant explosions
                    <br>called coronal mass ejections, influences the very nature of space and can interact with the magnetic
                    <br>systems of Earth and other worlds. Such effects also change the radiation environment through which our
                    <br>spacecraft – and, one day, our astronauts headed to Mars – travel. The space environment around Earth
                    <br>can also vary wildly in response not only to the Sun, but from upwelling atmospheric events from below
                    <br>Such space weather can interfere with satellite electronics, radio communications and GPS signals,
                    <br>spacecraft orbits, and even – when extreme – power grids on Earth. Like our terrestrial weather, space
                    <br>weather can be extreme at times, but exists all the time. As such, it is important to understand space
                    <br>weather in order to predict and accommodate to it.

                To understand the formation of a large and colorful aurora borealis like the one in the photo, it is necessary to remember that the particles 
                <br> released by our star create the so-called space weather throughout the Solar System</p>

    <p style=" font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em;"> 
    That's what happened in recent weeks, when a large active region on the Sun released several clouds of particles towards our planet. Of
    <br>course, the Earth's magnetic field protects us from most of them, but this time it was different: the solar plasma was so much that the
    <br>protective layer was stretched and affected to an unusual intensity
    </p>

    <p style=" font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1.1em;">
    Then, electrically charged particles from the Sun interacted with the atmosphere and produced northern and southern lights. It is worth
    <br>remembering that auroras are just one part of the effects of solar activity, as particles from our star can also cause induced currents in
    <br>electrical networks, failures in communications systems that use radio waves, among others.</p>
